== Description ==

Reed Write extends WordPress giving it the full capabilities of the most popular content management systems on the market. The plugin includes full control over post types, taxonomies.

The plugin uses the content types extensions built into WordPress 3 and therefore is only supported in WordPress 3+.

The plugin allows administators to make completely custom content types, and custom taxonomies (categories and tags).

The plugin presents formatted meta field values after the content if option is selected and also provides functions for creating templated field values.

The plugin is extensible so users can add their own custom coded field types.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `reed-write` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
