Reed Write extends WordPress giving it the full capabilities of the most popular content management systems on the market.

== Description ==

Reed Write extends WordPress giving it the full capabilities of the most popular content management systems on the market. The plugin includes full control over post types, taxonomies.

The plugin uses the content types extensions built into WordPress 3 and therefore is only supported in WordPress 3+.

The plugin allows administrators to make completely custom content types, and custom taxonomies (categories and tags).

The plugin presents formatted meta field values after the content if option is selected and also provides functions for including field values in custom templates.

The plugin enables the default WordPress to search custom meta field values and returns appropriate custom posts.

The plugin is extensible so users can add their own custom coded field types.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `reed-write` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. If you have installed my older plugin "Content Types WordPress Plugin" and created content types and taxonomies you will receive an error message when you try to activate this plugin. Follow the directions in the error message and your data will be saved and usable by this new Reed Write plugin.
